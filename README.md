This Python coding develops to calculate the total number of schools, students, budgets, and performance of math and reading scores by various categories, including local government areas, schools, top & bottom performing schools, years 9 â€“ 12, school spending, school size, and those school types. Data frames have been created to visualize the average budget, average math & reading score, and the % of passing levels based on the categories mentioned above. 

The scores by school type show that independent schools have better academic performance than government schools. Though average math & reading scores in these two types of schools have not much different, the overall passing rate in independent schools is 6% higher than the government schools. 
In addition, independent schools occupied 3 out of the top 5 and most of the bottom performing schools are government schools when sorting academic results by % Overall passing (math and reading) from top to bottom. 

Small-size schools with less than 1000 students have better academic performance than medium or large-size schools.  The overall passing rate is 9% higher than the large-size schools. It seems obvious that small-size schools may be easier to be managed than bigger-size schools.

There are 15 schools in the local area and has nearly 40,000 students with a 24 million budget in total. The overall academic performance is very satisfactory as it reaches 86% passing in math and 84% in reading.
